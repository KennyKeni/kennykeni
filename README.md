Aug 2023 - May 2026 | Atlanta, GA

## Experience

**Software Engineering Intern, Viasat**  
May 2025 - Aug 2025 | Carlsbad, CA
- Automated customer order validation and fulfillment with Python batch processing and AWS SQS, increasing processing speed by 300%.
- Built a concurrent distributed pipeline for 20+ simultaneous batches, reducing runtime from 4 hours to 10 minutes.
- Designed GraphQL endpoints and integrated AWS SQS, S3, and CloudWatch for real-time batch monitoring.

**Full Stack Developer, Bits of Good (Nonprofit)**  
Jan 2024 - Present | Atlanta, GA
- Built a web application with iCAN to gamify medication adherence for children in clinical trials.
- Implemented complex UI flows with React and Tailwind CSS for better usability and maintainability.
- Developed REST integration patterns with TanStack Query for reliable frontend-backend state synchronization.

**Machine Learning Undergraduate Researcher, Intelligent Digital Communications**  
Aug 2024 - Present | Atlanta, GA
- Developed a near real-time system to identify and triangulate wireless users (including drones) in signal-dense environments.
- Applied transfer learning to Co-DETR models using PyTorch and scikit-learn, reaching 85% detection accuracy.

## Selected Projects

**Agentic RAG** | Python, Go, FastAPI, LlamaIndex, Qdrant, SQLAlchemy, Docker  
Jul 2025 - Present
- Built an agentic RAG backend that reasons over user queries using vector retrieval.
